**Introduction to Linux and Shells**

---

### What is Linux?

Linux is an **operating system** similar to macOS and Windows. However, it is unique in being the most popular **open-source** OS, offering unparalleled freedom to users. Linux powers the majority of servers on the Internet and is the foundation for many platforms, including Android (a modified version of Linux).

The Linux **kernel** (the core of the operating system) was developed in 1991 by Linus Torvalds in Finland. This kernel forms the foundation of the GNU/Linux operating system, commonly referred to as **GNU/Linux**.

One of Linux's most significant advantages is the **freedom** it provides. Unlike operating systems controlled by companies like Microsoft or Apple, Linux allows users to do whatever they want with their machines. It is developed by a community of volunteers and companies, with no single commercial entity dictating its direction.

While many users use Linux for server-related tasks, it can also be used as a **day-to-day operating system**. Many distributions (or "distros") are available, such as **Debian**, **Red Hat**, and **Ubuntu**. Each distro packages Linux with additional tools and software to meet the needs of different users.

### Using Linux Without a Linux Machine

If you're using a **Mac**, you already have access to a **UNIX**-based system, which is similar to Linux in many ways. macOS includes a terminal that allows you to run Linux-like commands.

For **Windows** users, Microsoft provides an official **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**. This allows you to run Linux alongside Windows easily. To install WSL, open **PowerShell** as an administrator and run:

```
wsl --install
```

After installation and a system restart, search for and open **Ubuntu** to set up your credentials.

Alternatively, you can run Linux on a **Virtual Private Server (VPS)** from a cloud provider, such as **Digital Ocean**.

### What is a Linux Shell?

A **shell** is a command interpreter that provides an interface to the user to interact with the operating system. Through the shell, you can execute operations, run programs, and create scripts to automate tasks.

Some of the most common shells available in Linux include:

- **Bash** (Bourne Again Shell)
- **Zsh**
- **Csh**
- **Fish**

Each shell has unique features, but they all enable you to run commands and create programs. The **Bash shell**, created in 1989 as a free alternative to the proprietary Bourne shell, is one of the most popular shells used today, particularly in the **GNU** project.

### Using Linux Terminal in Windows

To run a Linux terminal on Windows:

1. Open **PowerShell** as an administrator and run:
   
   ```
   wsl --install
   ```

2. Restart your computer, search for **Ubuntu**, and open it.
3. Set up your user credentials in the Ubuntu terminal.
4. Install **Windows Terminal** from the Microsoft Store to manage your terminal sessions.

To reset the user password, you can open the root user in the command prompt:

```
ubuntu config --default-user root
```
Here's a brief guide on some essential Linux commands:

Here is your content converted into Markdown (`.md`) format:


### Bytes in ASCII vs Non-ASCII Charsets

Bytes in ASCII charsets equate to characters. But with non-ASCII charsets, the number of characters might differ because some characters might take multiple bytes (for example, this happens in Unicode).

In this case, the `-m` flag will help you get the correct value.

---

### Sort:

Suppose you have a text file that contains the names of dogs.

- `-u` flag is used to sort output with unique values.
- `-n` flag is used to sort output by numerical values.

---

### Uniq:

`uniq` is a command that helps you sort lines of text. You can get those lines from a file or use pipes from the output of another command.

```bash
uniq dogs.txt
ls | uniq
```

> Key thing to note: `uniq` will only detect adjacent duplicate lines. This implies that you will most likely use it along with `sort`.

The `sort` command has its own way to remove duplicates with the `-u` (unique) option, but `uniq` has more power.

- By default, it removes duplicate lines.
- You can display only duplicate lines with the `-d` flag:

```bash
sort dogs.txt | uniq -d
```

- Use the `-u` option to display only non-duplicate lines.

---

### Diff:

`diff` is a handy command when you have two files containing almost the same information, but you can't find the difference between them.

Example:

Suppose you have two files, `dogs.txt` and `moredogs.txt`. The difference is that `moredogs.txt` contains one more dog name.  
Running `diff dogs.txt moredogs.txt` will show you the extra line.

```bash
diff dogs.txt moredogs.txt
```

Using the `-y` option will compare the two files line by line.

---

### Find:

The `find` command is used to find files or folders matching a particular search pattern. It searches recursively.

Examples:

- To find all `.js` files under the current directory tree:

```bash
find . -name "*.js"
```

- To search by name in a specific directory:

```bash
find <file path> -name "*<filename>*"
```

Always use quotes around special characters like `*` to avoid shell interpretation.

- Find directories under the current tree that match the name "src":

```bash
find . -type d -name "src"
```

- `-type f` is used to search only for files, or `-type l` to search for symbolic links.
- `-name` is case-sensitive. Use `-iname` for case-insensitive searches.
- You can search multiple root directories:

```bash
find folder1 folder2 -name "filename.txt"
```

- Find specific directories such as `node_modules` or `public`:

```bash
find . -type d -name node_modules -or -name public
```

- Exclude a specific path:

```bash
find . -type d -name '*.md' -not -path 'node_modules/*'
```

- Search files that are larger than 100 bytes:

```bash
find . -type f -size +100c
```

- Find files modified more than 3 days ago:

```bash
find . -type f -mtime +3
```

- Find files edited in the last 24 hours:

```bash
find . -type f -mtime -1
```

- Delete files that match your search, such as all files edited in the last 24 hours:

```bash
find . -type f -mtime -1 -delete
```

---

### Grep:

`grep` is used to search for patterns in files or to filter the output of another command. It helps to find text inside files.

Example:

To find occurrences of `document.getElementById` in `index.md`:

```bash
grep document.getElementById index.md
```

- Show line numbers with the `-n` option:

```bash
grep -n document.getElementById index.md
```

- To print two lines before and after the matched line for more context, use `-C`:

```bash
grep -nC 2 document.getElementById index.md
```

- To invert the result and exclude lines that match a string, use `-v`:

```bash
less index.md | grep -v document.getElementById
```

- To search a string recursively in all files in a directory, use `-r`:

```bash
grep -r "text you want to search" .
```

- The `-i` flag can be used for case-insensitive searches (upper or lowercase doesn't matter):

```bash
grep -i "text you want to search" <filename>
```

- Case-insensitive search: 

```bash
grep -i "unix" filename.txt
```

- Count the number of matches:

```bash
grep -c "unix" filename.txt
```

- Display filenames that match the pattern:

```bash
grep -l "unix" *
grep -l "unix" f1.txt f2.txt f3.txt f4.txt
```

## `gzip`
`gzip` is used to compress files using the LZ77 algorithm.

- Compress a file:
  ```bash
  gzip filename
  ```
- Keep the original file while compressing:
  ```bash
  gzip -k filename
  ```
- Compress multiple files:
  ```bash
  gzip filename1 filename2
  ```
- Compress recursively in a directory:
  ```bash
  gzip -r directory_name
  ```
- Decompress a `.gz` file:
  ```bash
  gzip -d filename.gz
  ```
- Other options:
  - Compression levels: from `1` (fast, less compression) to `9` (slow, better compression).
  - Show compression percentage:
    ```bash
    gzip -v filename
    ```

Here's a concise guide on using the `chmod` command to manage file permissions in Linux and macOS:

## Understanding File Permissions

In Linux and UNIX-like systems, every file and directory has three types of permissions: **read (r)**, **write (w)**, and **execute (x)**. The permissions are displayed when you run the command `ls -al`, which provides detailed information about files and directories.

### File Type Indicators:
- **`-`**: Regular file
- **`d`**: Directory
- **`l`**: Symbolic link

### Permissions Structure
The permissions are displayed as a string of 10 characters. For example, `drwxr-xr-x` can be broken down as follows:

1. **First Character**: File type (`d`, `-`, or `l`)
2. **Next Nine Characters**: Permissions for:
   - **User (owner)**: `rwx` (read, write, execute)
   - **Group**: `r-x` (read, no write, execute)
   - **Others**: `r-x` (read, no write, execute)

### Permission Breakdown
Each permission can be represented as follows:
- **Read**: 4
- **Write**: 2
- **Execute**: 1

By summing these values, you can define permission sets:
- **0**: No permissions
- **1**: Execute only
- **2**: Write only
- **3**: Write and execute
- **4**: Read only
- **5**: Read and execute
- **6**: Read and write
- **7**: Read, write, and execute

### Changing Permissions with `chmod`
You can change permissions using the `chmod` command in two ways: **symbolic** and **numeric**.

#### Symbolic Mode
The syntax for symbolic mode is:
```bash
chmod [who][+|-|=][permissions] filename
```
Where:
- **who** can be `u` (user), `g` (group), `o` (others), or `a` (all).
- **+**: Add permission
- **-**: Remove permission
- **=**: Set exact permissions

**Examples**:
```bash
chmod a+r filename       # Everyone can read
chmod g-w filename       # Group cannot write
chmod o+x filename       # Others can execute
chmod ug+rw filename     # User and group can read and write
chmod o-rwx filename     # Others cannot read, write, or execute
```

To apply changes recursively to directories and their contents, use the `-R` flag:
```bash
chmod -R g+rw directory_name  # Group can read and write in all files and subdirectories
```

#### Numeric Mode
In numeric mode, permissions are set using three digits:
```bash
chmod [mode] filename
```
Where the mode consists of three digits representing user, group, and others.

**Examples**:
```bash
chmod 755 filename  # User can read/write/execute; group and others can read/execute
chmod 644 filename  # User can read/write; group and others can read
chmod 700 filename  # User can read/write/execute; group and others have no permissions
```

### Summary
- Use `ls -al` to view file permissions.
- Understand the permission structure (`rwx`).
- Use `chmod` with symbolic or numeric modes to modify permissions.
- Remember to apply the `-R` flag for recursive changes on directories.

This guide should help you manage file permissions effectively in a Linux or macOS environment!
